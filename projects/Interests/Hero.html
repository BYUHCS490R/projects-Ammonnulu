        <h2>AlluArjun - Indian Film Actor</h2>
    <main>
        <p>My favorite hero is Allu Arjun. He is one of the top heroes in India now. 
            His recent super hit movie is Pushpa 2. I like him because he is very talented in acting, 
            dancing, and action. He has won many awards for his performances, and I admire him as a role model.</p>
