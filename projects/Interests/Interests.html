        <h1>Kings food</h1>
        <p> My favorite food to cook and eat is Beef Biryani. 
            Because it was a royal food, in ancient times,kings used to eat it. 
            Over the generations, the cooking skills were passed down so that we can still enjoy this yummy dish today.
        </p>
        <p>I first saw biryani in a restaurant. 
            Later, I wanted to cook it myself for family and friends. 
            My Muslim friends taught me their recipe. Now I know how to cook it, and I feel happy when I make it at home. 
            It is more than food for me, it is also about culture and friendship.
