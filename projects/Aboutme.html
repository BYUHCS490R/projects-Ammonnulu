    <h1>Hello, my name is Ammon Nulu</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in Hyderabad, India. 
        I grew up learning the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
        My father is a returned missionary. 
        He saw that in our village there was no English medium school. 
        He talked with his missionary friends about it, 
        and with God help they started teaching children. 
        I studied in that school until 5th class. After that, 
        I went to another school and studied there until 10th class. 
        Later, I joined college and finished 12th class. For 10th, 
        11th, and 12th, I paid my own school fees. 
        I used to work in the daytime and study in the evenings. 
        At the end of the year, I wrote my exams.</p>
        <p>After that, I worked for a few years and went on a mission. 
            When I finished my mission, I applied to BYU-Hawaii and got admission. 
            I came to BYU-Hawaii for my undergraduate studies. 
            As a bonus, I can work part-time and I also got an opportunity 
            to work in the temple. Here in Hawaii I like some foods.</p>
<ol type="A">

        <li>Beef steak</li>
        <li>Jollibee</li>
        <li>Malasada</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><em><Strong>"If you offers me any of these foods, I promise I will enjoy it."</Strong></em></blockquote>
