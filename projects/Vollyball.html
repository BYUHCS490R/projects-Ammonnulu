        <p>I like playing volleyball very much. It is fun and keeps me active. I also like watching volleyball matches on TV. Volleyball teaches teamwork and helps me stay healthy.</p>
        <p>I used to wake up at 4 a.m. every day. I would go for running and do fitness training. After that, I practiced my game. I also used to take part in many tournaments.</p>
