        <h1>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?</h1>
        <p>The root is the main folder of your website. www.xyz.com/activity/page.html. Activity is the folder. Page.html is the file.</p>
        <h2>What is a default document?</h2>
        <p>It is the file that opens first when you visit a folder. Index.html is the default.</p>
        <h3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p>Absolute link is full web address, like https://www.xyz.com. Relative link is shows where the file is in your folders, like activity/page.html.
           They are easy when moving your website to another place.</p>
